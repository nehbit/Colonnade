# Colonnade

Colonnade is a Sublime Text package that allows you to set a default number of columns in your view as a default. Whenever you create a new Sublime text window, it will start with the number of columns you selected. Without this package, a new Sublime Text window will always start with only one column.

## Shortcuts

Colonnade comes with three shortcuts.

(```Super``` is a shorthand for ```Cmd``` on Mac OS, ```Alt``` on Windows, and ```Super``` on Linux.)

```Ctrl + Super + 2```: 2-column exact division layout, force retained

```Ctrl + Super + 3```: 3-column

```Ctrl + Super + 4```: 4-column

## Options

There are no options.

## Install

1) Open Sublime Text. Go to ```Preferences > Browse Packages```
2) Download this repository, and put the ```Colonnade``` folder into your Sublime Packages directory.

## Uninstall

1) Open Sublime Text. Go to ```Preferences > Browse Packages```
2) Delete ```Colonnade``` directory
3) Go to ```Preferences > Settings```. Look for the ```on_new_async_project``` key in the JSON file. Delete the key and the array it contains. If you don't know how to edit JSON, ask a friend to do it for you, you might accidentally corrupt your settings file if you do it wrong.
